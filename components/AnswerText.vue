      If you said yes to any of these questions, then you've made it to the
      right place. Tip Seeker was created on the principle that gig workers
      deserve absolute transparency with the orders they deal with. So now, you
      can avoid the tip baiters, unassign the bad tippers, and know which Karens
      need to be hit with the decline button!
